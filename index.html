          individual Access IDs, the Service may be identified separately and
          you may be charged for the use of additional Access IDs. In some
          cases, if your account(s) require two signatures for withdrawal, we
          may only grant view privileges to your Eligible Accounts through the

          scheduled through the Service but has not begun processing.

        <div class="fw-semibold text-lg">Signature Requirements</div>

          When any transfer, ACH, or other Payment Instruction is initiated
          through the Service for your benefit, you agree that we may debit the

          transfers initiated through the Service. Any Authorized User must be
          authorized individually to make electronic transfers and online Bill
          Payments even though that person’s authority to make transfers by

          verification by us. The balance reflected in the Service may differ
          from your records due to deposits in progress, checks outstanding, or
          other withdrawals, payments or charges. A transfer request may not
          result in immediate availability because of the time required to
          process the request. A transfer request must be made before the
          Business Day Cut-off time to be effective the same Business Day.

          summary page. There may be situations that cause a delay in an update
          of your balances. The Service will use the most current balance
          available at the time of a transaction to base our approval for
          account transfers.

          AND the information has been processed and/or transmitted to us
          through the Service; however, you can edit or change a transfer that
          is still “pending”. For Business Customers, the term “transfers” also
          includes ACH and wire transactions.

          processing. Separate agreements may detail the required time-frames
          for submitting and making changes to these types of transactions.

          Bill Payment and Transfer Limitations
        </div>
        <p>
          You may use the Service to check the balance of your Eligible
          Account(s) and to transfer funds among your Eligible Accounts at this
          Financial Institution. You must have sufficient funds in your account
          to cover the amount of any online transfers and Bill Payments on the
          scheduled payment date set for the transaction, or the transaction may
          not be processed. NSF and/or overdraft charges may be incurred if Bill
          Payments exceed your account balance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Current federal regulations restrict the number of transactions that
          you can make from certain types of accounts, such as Money Market and
          Savings Accounts. For these types of accounts, you may not make more
          than six (6) pre-authorized electronic transfers, which include
          computer initiated transfers, telephone transfers, checks, and
          point-of-sale transactions during a given monthly statement period.
          Transfers and Bill Payments authorized by personal computer through
          the Service are counted toward the six permitted monthly transfers.
          Bill Payments are considered third party transfers and are limited to
          three (3) transactions. Federal regulations currently place no limits
          on the number of transfers or BillPayments from your Checking (draft)
          accounts, therefore this financial institution currently limits the
          Bill Payment Service to only Checking (draft) Accounts.

        <div class="fw-semibold text-lg">Bill Payment Terms and Conditions</div>
        <p><strong>(A) Bill Payment Scheduling</strong></p>
        <p>
          The earliest possible Scheduled Payment Date for each Biller
          (typically four (4) or fewer Business Days from the current date) will
          be designated within the Service when you are scheduling the Bill
          Payment. Therefore, the Service will not permit you to select a
          Scheduled Payment Date less than the earliest possible Scheduled
          Payment Date designated for each Biller.
        </p>
        <p>
          When scheduling Bill Payments you must select a Scheduled Payment Date
          that is no later than the actual Due Date reflected on your Biller
          statement unless the Due Date falls on a non-Business Day. If the
          actual Due Date falls on a non-Business Day, you must select a
          Scheduled Payment Date that is at least one (1) Business Day before
          the actual Due Date. Scheduled Payment Dates must be prior to any late
          date or grace period.
        </p>
        <p><strong>(B) The Bill Payment Service Guarantee</strong></p>
        <p>
          Due to circumstances beyond the control of the Service, particularly
          delays in handling and posting payments by Billers or financial
          institutions, some transactions may take longer to be credited to your
          account. Except as expressly stated otherwise within this Agreement,
          this Financial Institution and/or its Service Providers will bear the
          responsibility for any late payment related charges up to $50.00
          should a Bill Payment post after its Due Date as long as the payment
          was scheduled in accordance with the guidelines described under “Bill
          Payment Scheduling” in this Agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(C) Payment Authorization and Payment Remittance</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          By providing the Service with names and account information of Billers
          to whom you wish to direct payments, you authorize us to follow the
          Payment Instructions received through the Service. In order to process
          payments more efficiently and effectively, our Service Provider may
          edit or alter payment data or data formats in accordance with Biller
          directives.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the Service receives a Payment Instruction, you authorize our
          Bill Payment Service Provider to debit your Payment Account and remit
          funds on your behalf so that the funds arrive as close as reasonably
          possible to the Scheduled Payment Date designated by you. You also
          authorize our Service Provider to credit your Payment Account for
          payments returned to the Service by the United States Postal Service
          or Biller, or payments remitted to you on behalf of another Authorized
          User of the Service.
        </p>
        <p><strong>(D) Payment Methods</strong></p>
        <p>
          Our Bill Payment Service Provider reserves the right to select the
          method in which to remit funds on your behalf to your Biller. These
          payment methods may include, but may not be limited to, an electronic
          payment, an electronic to check payment, or a Laser Draft Payment.
        </p>
        <p><strong>(E) Payment Cancellation Requests</strong></p>
        <p>
          You may cancel or edit any Scheduled Payment (if processing has not
          begun) by following the directions within the Service. There is no
          charge for canceling or editing a Scheduled Payment. However, once the
          Service has begun processing a Scheduled Payment it cannot be
          cancelled or edited, therefore a stop payment request must be
          submitted, as described within this Agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(F) Bill Payment Stop Payment Requests</strong><br />
          The ability of this Financial Institution and its Service Provider to
          process a stop payment on a Bill Payment request will depend on the
          payment method and whether or not a check or Laser Draft Payment has
          cleared. We may also not have a reasonable opportunity to act on any
          stop payment request after a payment has been processed. If you desire
          to stop any Bill Payment that has already been processed, you must
          contact our eBranch Department at 205-591-2228 or 1-800-223-2415.<br />
          Although we will make every effort to accommodate your request, we
          will have no liability for failing to do so. We may also require you
          to present your stop payment request in writing within fourteen (14)
          days. The charge for each stop payment request will be the current
          charge for such service as set forth in our applicable fee schedule.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(G) Returned Payments</strong><br />
          In using the Service, you understand that Billers and/or the United
          States Postal Service may return Bill Payments to our Service Provider
          for various reasons such as, but not limited to, Biller’s forwarding
          address expired; Biller account number is not valid; Biller is unable
          to locate account; or Biller account is paid in full. Our Service
          Provider will use its best efforts to research and correct the
          returned payment and return it to your Biller, or void the payment and
          credit your Payment Account. You may receive notification from the
          Service of returned payments.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(H) Bill Payment Information Authorization</strong><br />
          Requests for Bill Payment privileges may not be fulfilled if this

          Institution and its Service Providers reserve the right to obtain
          financial information regarding your account from a Biller or your
          Financial Institution (for example, to resolve payment posting
          problems or for verification).

          <strong>(J) Exception Payments</strong><br />
          Tax payments and court ordered payments may be scheduled through the
          Service; however, such payments are discouraged and are scheduled at
          your own risk. In no event shall this Financial Institution or its
          Service Provider(s) be liable for any claims or damages resulting from
          your scheduling of these types of payments. The Bill Payment Service
          Guarantee as it applies to any late payment related charges is void
          when these types of payments are scheduled and/or processed by the
          Service. Research of exception payments shall be limited to proof of
          payment and/or unauthorized payments only. All other research and
          resolution for any misapplied, mis-posted or misdirected exception

        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(K) Biller Limitation</strong><br />
          We reserve the right to refuse to pay any Biller to whom you may
          direct a payment. The Service will notify you promptly if it decides
          to refuse to pay a Biller designated by you. This notification is not
          required if you attempt to make a prohibited payment or an exception
          payment under this Agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(L) Failed Transactions</strong><br />

          from your Payment Account. If we are unable to complete the
          transaction for any reason associated with your Payment Account (for
          example, there are insufficient funds in your Payment Account to cover
          the transaction), the transaction will not be completed. In some
          instances, you will receive a return notice from the Service. In such

          The Service utilizes a comprehensive security strategy to protect your
          accounts and transactions conducted over the Internet. Prior to
          activating your access to the Service, our Internet Banking Department
          will verify your identity and authorization against information
          associated with the Eligible Account (s) that you request to be linked

          Access IDs and Passcodes - One of the main security features
          protecting the Service is the unique combination of your Access
          Identification Code (Access ID) and Passcode. During the enrollment
          process, you will be asked to select a unique Access ID, and then
          choose a Passcode that will be used to gain access to the Service. You
          determine your own Passcode, which is encrypted in our database.
          Neither this Institution nor its Service Providers have access to this
          information. The Service will automatically deactivate your account

          for assistance.

          Because your Passcode is used to access your accounts, you should
          treat it as you would any other sensitive personal data.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>You should carefully select a Passcode that is hard to guess.</li>
          <li>
            You should not use words based on your name, address or other

          <li>
            You should also change your Passcode occasionally, such as every 90
            days.
          </li>
          <li>
            A Passcode should be changed immediately if you suspect that your
            Passcode has been compromised. This can be done at any time from the
            “User Services” menu after you log on to the Service.

          NEITHER THIS INSTITUTION NOR ITS SERVICE PROVIDERS WILL CONTACT YOU
          VIA TELEPHONE OR EMAIL REQUESTING PERSONAL INFORMATION, YOUR ACCESS
          ID, OR YOUR PASSCODE. IF YOU ARE CONTACTED BY ANYONE REQUESTING THIS
          INFORMATION, PLEASE CONTACT US IMMEDIATELY.
        </p>
        <p>
          Encryption – The Service uses the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption
          technology for everything you do while using Internet banking. Your
          browser automatically activates this technology when it attempts to
          connect to our Service. The Service requires a browser that supports
          128-bit encryption. The Service will warn you if your browser does not
          meet this requirement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whenever SSL is securing your communications, the browser will
          typically indicate this secure session by changing the appearance of a
          small icon of a padlock at the bottom of the screen from “open” to
          “locked”. What this means to you is that your communications are
          scrambled from your browser to our servers at all times so no
          unauthorized party can read the information as it is carried over the
          Internet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Certificate Authority - The servers hosting the Service have been
          certified by a Certificate Authority to assure you that you are
          actually talking to the Service instead of someone pretending to be
          us. If you are using an older browser, such as anything prior to
          versions 4.0 on Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer, you will see
          that the Certificate Authorities key may have expired; you will need
          to update your browser. Instructions for upgrading your browser are
          located on the Browser SSL Update link, which is located on the
          Service login page. By clicking on the lock within the Service, you
          can view the certificate to ensure it’s valid.

        <p>
          Cookies - During your use of the Service, our Internet banking Service
          Provider will pass an encrypted cookie to your computer in order to
          identify your computer during the session. This cookie enables us to
          process multiple transactions during the session without having to
          provide an Access ID and Passcode for each individual transaction.
          Users must accept this cookie to use the Service. This cookie does not
          contain any personal information; it simply provides another level of
          security for our Internet banking product. The cookie is stored on
          your computer’s hard-drive, identifying your computer while you are
          logged on. When you log off, close your browser, or turn off your
          machine, the cookie will be destroyed. A new cookie is used for each
          session; thus, no one can use the prior cookie to access your account.

        <p>Additional Security Guidelines:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            All Authorized Users should sign-off after every Service session;
            however, online sessions will automatically end after ten (10)
            minutes of inactivity. This to protect you in case you accidentally
            leave your computer unattended after you log-in.
          </li>
          <li>
            The security of public computers (e.g. in a library, or Internet
            café) cannot be assured; therefore we recommend that you refrain
            from accessing the Service on a public computer.
          </li>
          <li>
            Routinely scan your computer, servers, and electronic media using a
            reliable virus detection product. Undetected or un-repaired viruses
            may corrupt and destroy your programs, files, and even your
            hardware. Additionally, you may unintentionally transmit a virus to
            other computers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use a firewall product (hardware and/or software), especially if you
            have a broadband Internet connection such as DSL or cable modem.
          </li>
          <li>
            Periodically update your computer operating system and browser for
            critical security related patches. We recommend use of the most
            current, fully patched, versions of Internet browsers for accessing
            the Service.

        <div class="fw-semibold text-lg">Your Passcode Responsibilities</div>
        <p>
          When you accept the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you agree
          not to give or make available your passcode or other means to access
          your to any unauthorized individuals. You are responsible for all

          permit other persons to use the Service, your passcode, or other means
          to access your account, you are responsible for any transactions they
          authorize.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you believe that your passcode or other means to access your
          account has been lost or stolen or that someone may attempt to use the
          Service without your consent or has transferred money without your
          permission, you must notify us at once by calling 205-591-2228 or
          1-800-223-2415 during customer service hours. You can also contact us
          by sending a secure message through the Service.

          IF YOU OR YOUR AUTHORIZED USERS DISCLOSE YOUR PASSCODE TO ANYONE,
          AND/OR IF YOU ALLOW SOMEONE TO USE YOUR PASSCODE TO ACCESS YOUR
          ACCOUNTS, YOU ARE AUTHORIZING THEM TO ACT ON YOUR BEHALF AND YOU WILL
          BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY USE OF THE SERVICE BY THEM (E.G., SUCH AS WHEN
          YOU PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION TO A JOINT ACCOUNT HOLDER, AN EMPLOYEE,
          AND/OR AN AGGREGATION SERVICE PROVIDER).

            If your computer, software, telecommunication lines were not working
            properly and this problem should have been apparent to you when you
            attempted the transfer or Bill Payment;
          </li>

            It can be shown that the Biller received the Bill Payment within the
            normal delivery timeframe and failed to process the payment through
            no fault of ours;

            The payment or transaction request involves funds subject to hold,

            withdrawal;
          </li>
          <li>
            We have reason to believe that a payment or other transaction

        <p><strong>(A) Errors and Questions </strong></p>
        <p>
          In case of errors or questions about your electronic transactions, you
          should notify us as soon as possible through one of the following
          methods:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Telephone us at 205-591-2228 or 800-223-2415 during customer service
            hours;
          </li>
          <li>
            Contact us by using the secure messaging feature within the Service;

          <li>Write to us at P. O. Box 2327, Birmingham, AL 35201</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <p>
        If you think your statement is incorrect or you need more information
        about an electronic transfer or Bill Payment transaction listed on the
        statement, we must hear from you no later than sixty (60) days after the
        FIRST statement was sent to you on which the problem or error appears.
        You must:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Tell us your name, relevant Service account number(s), and Access ID;
        </li>
        <li>
          Describe the error or the transaction in question, and explain as
          clearly as possible why you believe it is an error or why you need
          more information; and,
        </li>
        <li>Tell us the dollar amount of the suspected error.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        If you tell us verbally, we may require that you send your complaint in
        writing within ten (10) Business Days after your verbal notification. We
        will tell you the results of our investigation within ten (10) Business
        Days after we hear from you, and will correct any error promptly.
        However, if we require more time to confirm the nature of your complaint
        or question, we reserve the right to take up to forty-five (45) days to
        complete our investigation. If we decide to do this, we will
        provisionally credit your account within ten (10) Business Days for the
        amount you think is in error. If we ask you to submit your complaint or
        question in writing and we do not receive it within ten (10) Business
        Days, we may not provisionally credit your account.
      </p>
      <p>
        For errors regarding electronic transactions on new consumer accounts,
        we may take up to 90 days to investigate your complaint or question. We
        may take up to 20 Business Days to credit a new account for the amount
        you think is in error.
      </p>
      <p>
        If it is determined there was no error, we will mail you a written
        explanation within three (3) Business Days after completion of our
        investigation. You may ask for copies of documents used in our
        investigation. The Service may revoke any provisional credit provided to
        you if we find an error did not occur.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>B) Consumer Liability for Unauthorized Transfers</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Tell us AT ONCE if you believe your Access ID or Passcode has been lost
        or stolen. Telephoning is the best way of minimizing your possible
        losses. You could lose all the money in your account (plus your maximum
        overdraft line of credit if applicable).
      </p>
      <p>
        If consumer customers tell us within two (2) Business Days after you
        discover your password or other means to access your account has been
        lost or stolen, your liability is no more than $50.00 should someone
        access your account without your permission. If you do not tell us
        within two (2) Business Days after you learn of such loss or theft, and
        we can prove that we could have prevented the unauthorized use of your
        password or other means to access your account if you had told us, you
        could be liable for as much as $500.00.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your monthly account statement contains transfers that you did not
        authorize, you must tell us at once. If you do not tell us within sixty
        (60) days after the statement was sent to you, you may lose any amount
        transferred without your authorization after the sixty (60) days if we
        can prove that we could have stopped someone from taking the money had
        you told us in time. If a good reason (such as a long trip or a hospital
        stay) prevented you from telling us, we may extend the period.
