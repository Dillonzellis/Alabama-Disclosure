            When you first enroll for the Basic Internet Banking Service we will
            link all of your designated Eligible Accounts to one Access ID. If
            you want to limit the accounts linked or the privileges assigned to
            an account, please contact us at 205-591-2228 or 1-800-223-2415 or

          <div class="fw-semibold text-lg">Signature Requirements</div>
          <p>
            When any transfer, ACH, or other Payment Instruction is initiated
            through the Service for your benefit, you agree that we may debit
            the designated Eligible Accounts without requiring your signature on
            the item and without any notice to you. Requirements for dual
            signatures on checks, if applicable, do NOT apply to Bill Payments
            or other transfers initiated through the Service. Any Authorized
            User must be authorized individually to make electronic transfers
            and online Bill Payments even though that person’s authority to make
            transfers by other means may still require dual signatures.

          <p>
            Balances shown in your accounts may include deposits subject to
            verification by us. The balance reflected in the Service may differ
            from your records due to deposits in progress, checks outstanding,
            or other withdrawals, payments or charges. A transfer request may
            not result in immediate availability because of the time required to
            process the request. A transfer request must be made before the
            Business Day Cut-off time to be effective the same Business Day.
          </p>
          <p>
            The balances within the Service are updated periodically and the
            Service will display the most current "as of" date on the "accounts"
            summary page. There may be situations that cause a delay in an
            update of your balances. The Service will use the most current
            balance available at the time of a transaction to base our approval
            for account transfers.

            system AND the information has been processed and/or transmitted to
            us through the Service; however, you can edit or change a transfer
            that is still “pending”. For Business Customers, the term

            further processing. Separate agreements may detail the required
            time-frames for submitting and making changes to these types of
            transactions.

            Bill Payment and Transfer Limitations
          </div>
          <p>
            You may use the Service to check the balance of your Eligible
            Account(s) and to transfer funds among your Eligible Accounts at
            this Financial Institution. You must have sufficient funds in your
            account to cover the amount of any online transfers and Bill
            Payments on the scheduled payment date set for the transaction, or
            the transaction may not be processed. NSF and/or overdraft charges
            may be incurred if Bill Payments exceed your account balance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Current federal regulations restrict the number of transactions that
            you can make from certain types of accounts, such as Money Market
            and Savings Accounts. For these types of accounts, you may not make
            more than six (6) pre-authorized electronic transfers, which include
            computer initiated transfers, telephone transfers, checks, and
            point-of-sale transactions during a given monthly statement period.
            Transfers and Bill Payments authorized by personal computer through
            the Service are counted toward the six permitted monthly transfers.
            Bill Payments are considered third party transfers and are limited
            to three (3) transactions. Federal regulations currently place no
            limits on the number of transfers or BillPayments from your Checking
            (draft) accounts, therefore this financial institution currently
            limits the Bill Payment Service to only Checking (draft) Accounts.

            Bill Payment Terms and Conditions
          </div>
          <p><strong>(A) Bill Payment Scheduling</strong></p>
          <p>
            The earliest possible Scheduled Payment Date for each Biller
            (typically four (4) or fewer Business Days from the current date)
            will be designated within the Service when you are scheduling the
            Bill Payment. Therefore, the Service will not permit you to select a
            Scheduled Payment Date less than the earliest possible Scheduled
            Payment Date designated for each Biller.
          </p>
          <p>
            When scheduling Bill Payments you must select a Scheduled Payment
            Date that is no later than the actual Due Date reflected on your
            Biller statement unless the Due Date falls on a non-Business Day. If
            the actual Due Date falls on a non-Business Day, you must select a
            Scheduled Payment Date that is at least one (1) Business Day before
            the actual Due Date. Scheduled Payment Dates must be prior to any
            late date or grace period.
          </p>
          <p><strong>(B) The Bill Payment Service Guarantee</strong></p>
          <p>
            Due to circumstances beyond the control of the Service, particularly
            delays in handling and posting payments by Billers or financial
            institutions, some transactions may take longer to be credited to
            your account. Except as expressly stated otherwise within this
            Agreement, this Financial Institution and/or its Service Providers
            will bear the responsibility for any late payment related charges up
            to $50.00 should a Bill Payment post after its Due Date as long as
            the payment was scheduled in accordance with the guidelines
            described under “Bill Payment Scheduling” in this Agreement.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>(C) Payment Authorization and Payment Remittance</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            By providing the Service with names and account information of
            Billers to whom you wish to direct payments, you authorize us to
            follow the Payment Instructions received through the Service. In
            order to process payments more efficiently and effectively, our
            Service Provider may edit or alter payment data or data formats in
            accordance with Biller directives.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the Service receives a Payment Instruction, you authorize our
            Bill Payment Service Provider to debit your Payment Account and
            remit funds on your behalf so that the funds arrive as close as
            reasonably possible to the Scheduled Payment Date designated by you.
            You also authorize our Service Provider to credit your Payment
            Account for payments returned to the Service by the United States
            Postal Service or Biller, or payments remitted to you on behalf of
            another Authorized User of the Service.
          </p>
          <p><strong>(D) Payment Methods</strong></p>
          <p>
            Our Bill Payment Service Provider reserves the right to select the
            method in which to remit funds on your behalf to your Biller. These
            payment methods may include, but may not be limited to, an
            electronic payment, an electronic to check payment, or a Laser Draft
            Payment.
          </p>
          <p><strong>(E) Payment Cancellation Requests</strong></p>
          <p>
            You may cancel or edit any Scheduled Payment (if processing has not
            begun) by following the directions within the Service. There is no
            charge for canceling or editing a Scheduled Payment. However, once
            the Service has begun processing a Scheduled Payment it cannot be
            cancelled or edited, therefore a stop payment request must be
            submitted, as described within this Agreement.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>(F) Bill Payment Stop Payment Requests</strong><br />
            The ability of this Financial Institution and its Service Provider
            to process a stop payment on a Bill Payment request will depend on
            the payment method and whether or not a check or Laser Draft Payment
            has cleared. We may also not have a reasonable opportunity to act on
            any stop payment request after a payment has been processed. If you
            desire to stop any Bill Payment that has already been processed, you
            must contact our eBranch Department at 205-591-2228 or
            1-800-223-2415.<br />
            Although we will make every effort to accommodate your request, we
            will have no liability for failing to do so. We may also require you
            to present your stop payment request in writing within fourteen (14)
            days. The charge for each stop payment request will be the current
            charge for such service as set forth in our applicable fee schedule.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>(G) Returned Payments</strong><br />
            In using the Service, you understand that Billers and/or the United
            States Postal Service may return Bill Payments to our Service
            Provider for various reasons such as, but not limited to, Biller’s
            forwarding address expired; Biller account number is not valid;
            Biller is unable to locate account; or Biller account is paid in
            full. Our Service Provider will use its best efforts to research and
            correct the returned payment and return it to your Biller, or void
            the payment and credit your Payment Account. You may receive
            notification from the Service of returned payments.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>(H) Bill Payment Information Authorization</strong><br />
            Requests for Bill Payment privileges may not be fulfilled if this
            Financial Institution and/or its Service Provider(s) cannot verify
            your identity and withdrawal authority over the specified accounts.
            Through your enrollment in the Bill Payment Service; you agree that
            this Financial Institution and its Service Providers reserve the
            right to request a review of your credit rating at our own expense
            through an authorized bureau. In addition, you agree that this
            Financial Institution and its Service Providers reserve the right to
            obtain financial information regarding your account from a Biller or
            your Financial Institution (for example, to resolve payment posting
            problems or for verification).
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>(I) Prohibited Payments</strong><br />
            Payments to Billers outside of the United States or its territories
            are prohibited through the Service.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>(J) Exception Payments</strong><br />
            Tax payments and court ordered payments may be scheduled through the
            Service; however, such payments are discouraged and are scheduled at
            your own risk. In no event shall this Financial Institution or its
            Service Provider(s) be liable for any claims or damages resulting
            from your scheduling of these types of payments. The Bill Payment
            Service Guarantee as it applies to any late payment related charges
            is void when these types of payments are scheduled and/or processed
            by the Service. Research of exception payments shall be limited to
            proof of payment and/or unauthorized payments only. All other
            research and resolution for any misapplied, mis-posted or
            misdirected exception payments will be your sole responsibility.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>(K) Biller Limitation</strong><br />
            We reserve the right to refuse to pay any Biller to whom you may
            direct a payment. The Service will notify you promptly if it decides
            to refuse to pay a Biller designated by you. This notification is
            not required if you attempt to make a prohibited payment or an
            exception payment under this Agreement.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>(L) Failed Transactions</strong><br />
            In using the Service, you are requesting us to make payments for you
            from your Payment Account. If we are unable to complete the
            transaction for any reason associated with your Payment Account (for
            example, there are insufficient funds in your Payment Account to
            cover the transaction), the transaction will not be completed. In
            some instances, you will receive a return notice from the Service.
            In such case, you agree that:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              You will reimburse our Service Provider immediately upon demand
              the transaction amount that has been returned;
            </li>
            <li>
              For any amount not reimbursed to the Service Provider within
              fifteen (15) days of the initial notification, a late charge may
              be assessed each month against unpaid amounts equal to 1.5% or the
              legal maximum, whichever rate is lower;
            </li>
            <li>
              You will reimburse our Service Provider for any fees, it may incur
              in attempting to collect the amount of the return from you; and

          <p>
            It is our general policy to treat your account information as
            confidential. However, we will disclose information to third parties
            about your account or the transactions you make ONLY in the
            following situations:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Where it is necessary for completing transactions;</li>
            <li>Where it is necessary for activating additional services;</li>
            <li>
              In order to verify the existence and condition of your account to

            <li>

          <div class="fw-semibold text-lg">Internet Security</div>
          <p>
            The Service utilizes a comprehensive security strategy to protect
            your accounts and transactions conducted over the Internet. Prior to
            activating your access to the Service, our Internet Banking
            Department will verify your identity and authorization against
            information associated with the Eligible Account (s) that you
            request to be linked to the Service.
          </p>
          <p>
            Access IDs and Passcodes - One of the main security features
            protecting the Service is the unique combination of your Access
            Identification Code (Access ID) and Passcode. During the enrollment
            process, you will be asked to select a unique Access ID, and then
            choose a Passcode that will be used to gain access to the Service.
            You determine your own Passcode, which is encrypted in our database.
            Neither this Institution nor its Service Providers have access to
            this information. The Service will automatically deactivate your
            account after three unsuccessful login attempts within a 24-hour
            time frame. You may reset your passcode online or you may contact
            this Institution for assistance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because your Passcode is used to access your accounts, you should
            treat it as you would any other sensitive personal data.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              You should carefully select a Passcode that is hard to guess.
            </li>
            <li>
              You should not use words based on your name, address or other
              personal information.
            </li>
            <li>Special characters may be used to increase security.</li>
            <li>Do NOT use dictionary words.</li>
            <li>Keep your Passcode safe.</li>
            <li>Memorize your Passcode and do NOT write it down.</li>
            <li>
              You should also change your Passcode occasionally, such as every
              90 days.
            </li>
            <li>
              A Passcode should be changed immediately if you suspect that your
              Passcode has been compromised. This can be done at any time from
              the “User Services” menu after you log on to the Service.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            NEITHER THIS INSTITUTION NOR ITS SERVICE PROVIDERS WILL CONTACT YOU
            VIA TELEPHONE OR EMAIL REQUESTING PERSONAL INFORMATION, YOUR ACCESS
            ID, OR YOUR PASSCODE. IF YOU ARE CONTACTED BY ANYONE REQUESTING THIS
            INFORMATION, PLEASE CONTACT US IMMEDIATELY.
          </p>
          <p>
            Encryption – The Service uses the Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
            encryption technology for everything you do while using Internet
            banking. Your browser automatically activates this technology when
            it attempts to connect to our Service. The Service requires a
            browser that supports 128-bit encryption. The Service will warn you
            if your browser does not meet this requirement.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whenever SSL is securing your communications, the browser will
            typically indicate this secure session by changing the appearance of
            a small icon of a padlock at the bottom of the screen from “open” to
            “locked”. What this means to you is that your communications are
            scrambled from your browser to our servers at all times so no
            unauthorized party can read the information as it is carried over
            the Internet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Certificate Authority - The servers hosting the Service have been
            certified by a Certificate Authority to assure you that you are
            actually talking to the Service instead of someone pretending to be
            us. If you are using an older browser, such as anything prior to
            versions 4.0 on Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer, you will
            see that the Certificate Authorities key may have expired; you will
            need to update your browser. Instructions for upgrading your browser
            are located on the Browser SSL Update link, which is located on the
            Service login page. By clicking on the lock within the Service, you
            can view the certificate to ensure it’s valid.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cookies - During your use of the Service, our Internet banking
            Service Provider will pass an encrypted cookie to your computer in
            order to identify your computer during the session. This cookie
            enables us to process multiple transactions during the session
            without having to provide an Access ID and Passcode for each
            individual transaction. Users must accept this cookie to use the
            Service. This cookie does not contain any personal information; it
            simply provides another level of security for our Internet banking
            product. The cookie is stored on your computer’s hard-drive,
            identifying your computer while you are logged on. When you log off,
            close your browser, or turn off your machine, the cookie will be
            destroyed. A new cookie is used for each session; thus, no one can
            use the prior cookie to access your account.
