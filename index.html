        <p>
          When any transfer, ACH, or other Payment Instruction is
          initiated through the Service for your benefit, you agree
          that we may debit the designated Eligible Accounts without
          requiring your signature on the item and without any notice
          to you. Requirements for dual signatures on checks, if
          applicable, do NOT apply to Bill Payments or other transfers
          initiated through the Service. Any Authorized User must be
          authorized individually to make electronic transfers and
          online Bill Payments even though that person’s authority to
          make transfers by other means may still require dual
          signatures.

        <p>
          Balances shown in your accounts may include deposits subject
          to verification by us. The balance reflected in the Service
          may differ from your records due to deposits in progress,
          checks outstanding, or other withdrawals, payments or
          charges. A transfer request may not result in immediate
          availability because of the time required to process the
          request. A transfer request must be made before the Business
          Day Cut-off time to be effective the same Business Day.
        </p>
        <p>
          The balances within the Service are updated periodically and
          the Service will display the most current "as of" date on
          the "accounts" summary page. There may be situations that
          cause a delay in an update of your balances. The Service
          will use the most current balance available at the time of a
          transaction to base our approval for account transfers.

          13. Bill Payment and Transfer Limitations
        </div>
        <p>
          You may use the Service to check the balance of your
          Eligible Account(s) and to transfer funds among your
          Eligible Accounts at this Financial Institution. You must
          have sufficient funds in your account to cover the amount of
          any online transfers and Bill Payments on the scheduled
          payment date set for the transaction, or the transaction may
          not be processed. NSF and/or overdraft charges may be
          incurred if Bill Payments exceed your account balance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Current federal regulations restrict the number of
          transactions that you can make from certain types of
          accounts, such as Money Market and Savings Accounts. For
          these types of accounts, you may not make more than six (6)
          pre-authorized electronic transfers, which include computer
          initiated transfers, telephone transfers, checks, and
          point-of-sale transactions during a given monthly statement
          period. Transfers and Bill Payments authorized by personal
          computer through the Service are counted toward the six
          permitted monthly transfers. Bill Payments are considered
          third party transfers and are limited to three (3)
          transactions. Federal regulations currently place no limits
          on the number of transfers or BillPayments from your
          Checking (draft) accounts, therefore this financial
          institution currently limits the Bill Payment Service to
          only Checking (draft) Accounts.

          14. Bill Payment Terms and Conditions
        </div>
        <p><strong>(A) Bill Payment Scheduling</strong></p>
        <p>
          The earliest possible Scheduled Payment Date for each Biller
          (typically four (4) or fewer Business Days from the current
          date) will be designated within the Service when you are
          scheduling the Bill Payment. Therefore, the Service will not
          permit you to select a Scheduled Payment Date less than the
          earliest possible Scheduled Payment Date designated for each
          Biller.
        </p>
        <p>
          When scheduling Bill Payments you must select a Scheduled
          Payment Date that is no later than the actual Due Date
          reflected on your Biller statement unless the Due Date falls
          on a non-Business Day. If the actual Due Date falls on a
          non-Business Day, you must select a Scheduled Payment Date
          that is at least one (1) Business Day before the actual Due
          Date. Scheduled Payment Dates must be prior to any late date
          or grace period.
        </p>
        <p><strong>(B) The Bill Payment Service Guarantee</strong></p>
        <p>
          Due to circumstances beyond the control of the Service,
          particularly delays in handling and posting payments by
          Billers or financial institutions, some transactions may
          take longer to be credited to your account. Except as
          expressly stated otherwise within this Agreement, this
          Financial Institution and/or its Service Providers will bear
          the responsibility for any late payment related charges up
          to $50.00 should a Bill Payment post after its Due Date as
          long as the payment was scheduled in accordance with the
          guidelines described under “Bill Payment Scheduling” in this
          Agreement.

            >(C) Payment Authorization and Payment Remittance</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          By providing the Service with names and account information
          of Billers to whom you wish to direct payments, you
          authorize us to follow the Payment Instructions received
          through the Service. In order to process payments more
          efficiently and effectively, our Service Provider may edit
          or alter payment data or data formats in accordance with
          Biller directives.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the Service receives a Payment Instruction, you
          authorize our Bill Payment Service Provider to debit your
          Payment Account and remit funds on your behalf so that the
          funds arrive as close as reasonably possible to the
          Scheduled Payment Date designated by you. You also authorize
          our Service Provider to credit your Payment Account for
          payments returned to the Service by the United States Postal
          Service or Biller, or payments remitted to you on behalf of
          another Authorized User of the Service.
        </p>
        <p><strong>(D) Payment Methods</strong></p>
        <p>
          Our Bill Payment Service Provider reserves the right to
          select the method in which to remit funds on your behalf to
          your Biller. These payment methods may include, but may not
          be limited to, an electronic payment, an electronic to check
          payment, or a Laser Draft Payment.
        </p>
        <p><strong>(E) Payment Cancellation Requests</strong></p>
        <p>
          You may cancel or edit any Scheduled Payment (if processing
          has not begun) by following the directions within the
          Service. There is no charge for canceling or editing a
          Scheduled Payment. However, once the Service has begun
          processing a Scheduled Payment it cannot be cancelled or
          edited, therefore a stop payment request must be submitted,
          as described within this Agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(F) Bill Payment Stop Payment Requests</strong
          ><br />
          The ability of this Financial Institution and its Service
          Provider to process a stop payment on a Bill Payment request
          will depend on the payment method and whether or not a check
          or Laser Draft Payment has cleared. We may also not have a
          reasonable opportunity to act on any stop payment request
          after a payment has been processed. If you desire to stop
          any Bill Payment that has already been processed, you must
          contact our eBranch Department at 205-591-2228 or
          1-800-223-2415.<br />
          Although we will make every effort to accommodate your
          request, we will have no liability for failing to do so. We
          may also require you to present your stop payment request in
          writing within fourteen (14) days. The charge for each stop
          payment request will be the current charge for such service
          as set forth in our applicable fee schedule.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(G) Returned Payments</strong><br />
          In using the Service, you understand that Billers and/or the
          United States Postal Service may return Bill Payments to our
          Service Provider for various reasons such as, but not
          limited to, Biller’s forwarding address expired; Biller
          account number is not valid; Biller is unable to locate
          account; or Biller account is paid in full. Our Service
          Provider will use its best efforts to research and correct
          the returned payment and return it to your Biller, or void
          the payment and credit your Payment Account. You may receive
          notification from the Service of returned payments.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(H) Bill Payment Information Authorization</strong
          ><br />
          Requests for Bill Payment privileges may not be fulfilled if
          this Financial Institution and/or its Service Provider(s)
          cannot verify your identity and withdrawal authority over
          the specified accounts. Through your enrollment in the Bill
          Payment Service; you agree that this Financial Institution
          and its Service Providers reserve the right to request a
          review of your credit rating at our own expense through an
          authorized bureau. In addition, you agree that this
          Financial Institution and its Service Providers reserve the
          right to obtain financial information regarding your account
          from a Biller or your Financial Institution (for example, to
          resolve payment posting problems or for verification).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(I) Prohibited Payments</strong><br />
          Payments to Billers outside of the United States or its
          territories are prohibited through the Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(J) Exception Payments</strong><br />
          Tax payments and court ordered payments may be scheduled
          through the Service; however, such payments are discouraged
          and are scheduled at your own risk. In no event shall this
          Financial Institution or its Service Provider(s) be liable
          for any claims or damages resulting from your scheduling of
          these types of payments. The Bill Payment Service Guarantee
          as it applies to any late payment related charges is void
          when these types of payments are scheduled and/or processed
          by the Service. Research of exception payments shall be
          limited to proof of payment and/or unauthorized payments
          only. All other research and resolution for any misapplied,
          mis-posted or misdirected exception payments will be your
          sole responsibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(K) Biller Limitation</strong><br />
          We reserve the right to refuse to pay any Biller to whom you
          may direct a payment. The Service will notify you promptly
          if it decides to refuse to pay a Biller designated by you.
          This notification is not required if you attempt to make a
          prohibited payment or an exception payment under this
          Agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>(L) Failed Transactions</strong><br />
          In using the Service, you are requesting us to make payments
          for you from your Payment Account. If we are unable to

          Payment Account (for example, there are insufficient funds
          in your Payment Account to cover the transaction), the
          transaction will not be completed. In some instances, you
          will receive a return notice from the Service. In such case,

        <div class="fw-semibold text-lg">17. Internet Security</div>
        <p>
          The Service utilizes a comprehensive security strategy to
          protect your accounts and transactions conducted over the
          Internet. Prior to activating your access to the Service,
          our Internet Banking Department will verify your identity
          and authorization against information associated with the
          Eligible Account (s) that you request to be linked to the
          Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          Access IDs and Passcodes - One of the main security features
          protecting the Service is the unique combination of your
          Access Identification Code (Access ID) and Passcode. During
          the enrollment process, you will be asked to select a unique
          Access ID, and then choose a Passcode that will be used to
          gain access to the Service. You determine your own Passcode,
          which is encrypted in our database. Neither this Institution
          nor its Service Providers have access to this information.
          The Service will automatically deactivate your account after
          three unsuccessful login attempts within a 24-hour time
          frame. You may reset your passcode online or you may contact
          this Institution for assistance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because your Passcode is used to access your accounts, you
          should treat it as you would any other sensitive personal
          data.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            You should carefully select a Passcode that is hard to
            guess.
          </li>
          <li>
            You should not use words based on your name, address or
            other personal information.
          </li>
          <li>
            Special characters may be used to increase security.
          </li>
          <li>Do NOT use dictionary words.</li>
          <li>Keep your Passcode safe.</li>
          <li>Memorize your Passcode and do NOT write it down.</li>
          <li>
            You should also change your Passcode occasionally, such as
            every 90 days.
          </li>
          <li>
            A Passcode should be changed immediately if you suspect
            that your Passcode has been compromised. This can be done
            at any time from the “User Services” menu after you log on
            to the Service.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          NEITHER THIS INSTITUTION NOR ITS SERVICE PROVIDERS WILL
          CONTACT YOU VIA TELEPHONE OR EMAIL REQUESTING PERSONAL
          INFORMATION, YOUR ACCESS ID, OR YOUR PASSCODE. IF YOU ARE
          CONTACTED BY ANYONE REQUESTING THIS INFORMATION, PLEASE
          CONTACT US IMMEDIATELY.
        </p>
        <p>
          Encryption – The Service uses the Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
          encryption technology for everything you do while using
          Internet banking. Your browser automatically activates this
          technology when it attempts to connect to our Service. The
          Service requires a browser that supports 128-bit encryption.
          The Service will warn you if your browser does not meet this
          requirement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whenever SSL is securing your communications, the browser
          will typically indicate this secure session by changing the
          appearance of a small icon of a padlock at the bottom of the
          screen from “open” to “locked”. What this means to you is
          that your communications are scrambled from your browser to
          our servers at all times so no unauthorized party can read
          the information as it is carried over the Internet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Certificate Authority - The servers hosting the Service have
          been certified by a Certificate Authority to assure you that
          you are actually talking to the Service instead of someone
          pretending to be us. If you are using an older browser, such
          as anything prior to versions 4.0 on Netscape Navigator or
          Internet Explorer, you will see that the Certificate
          Authorities key may have expired; you will need to update
          your browser. Instructions for upgrading your browser are
          located on the Browser SSL Update link, which is located on
          the Service login page. By clicking on the lock within the
          Service, you can view the certificate to ensure it’s valid.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cookies - During your use of the Service, our Internet
          banking Service Provider will pass an encrypted cookie to
          your computer in order to identify your computer during the
          session. This cookie enables us to process multiple
          transactions during the session without having to provide an
          Access ID and Passcode for each individual transaction.
          Users must accept this cookie to use the Service. This
          cookie does not contain any personal information; it simply
          provides another level of security for our Internet banking
          product. The cookie is stored on your computer’s hard-drive,
          identifying your computer while you are logged on. When you
          log off, close your browser, or turn off your machine, the
          cookie will be destroyed. A new cookie is used for each
          session; thus, no one can use the prior cookie to access
          your account.
        </p>
        <p>Additional Security Guidelines:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            All Authorized Users should sign-off after every Service
            session; however, online sessions will automatically end
            after ten (10) minutes of inactivity. This to protect you
            in case you accidentally leave your computer unattended
            after you log-in.
          </li>
          <li>
            The security of public computers (e.g. in a library, or
            Internet café) cannot be assured; therefore we recommend
            that you refrain from accessing the Service on a public
            computer.
          </li>
          <li>
            Routinely scan your computer, servers, and electronic
            media using a reliable virus detection product. Undetected
            or un-repaired viruses may corrupt and destroy your
            programs, files, and even your hardware. Additionally, you
            may unintentionally transmit a virus to other computers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use a firewall product (hardware and/or software),
            especially if you have a broadband Internet connection
            such as DSL or cable modem.
          </li>
          <li>
            Periodically update your computer operating system and
            browser for critical security related patches. We
            recommend use of the most current, fully patched, versions
            of Internet browsers for accessing the Service.

          18. Your Passcode Responsibilities
        </div>
        <p>
          When you accept the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
          you agree not to give or make available your passcode or
          other means to access your to any unauthorized individuals.
          You are responsible for all transfers and Bill Payments you
          authorize using the Service. If you permit other persons to
          use the Service, your passcode, or other means to access
          your account, you are responsible for any transactions they
          authorize.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you believe that your passcode or other means to access
          your account has been lost or stolen or that someone may
          attempt to use the Service without your consent or has
          transferred money without your permission, you must notify
          us at once by calling 205-591-2228 or 1-800-223-2415 during
          customer service hours. You can also contact us by sending a
          secure message through the Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          IF YOU OR YOUR AUTHORIZED USERS DISCLOSE YOUR PASSCODE TO
          ANYONE, AND/OR IF YOU ALLOW SOMEONE TO USE YOUR PASSCODE TO
          ACCESS YOUR ACCOUNTS, YOU ARE AUTHORIZING THEM TO ACT ON
          YOUR BEHALF AND YOU WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY USE OF THE
          SERVICE BY THEM (E.G., SUCH AS WHEN YOU PROVIDE THIS
          INFORMATION TO A JOINT ACCOUNT HOLDER, AN EMPLOYEE, AND/OR
          AN AGGREGATION SERVICE PROVIDER).
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the security features described above, there
          may be other security related notices posted on our website
          or the Service from time-to-time. It is your responsibility
          to read all security notices.

        </div>
        <p>
          We will use commercially reasonable efforts to make all your
          transfers and Bill Payments properly. However, we shall
          incur no liability and any Bill Payment Service Guarantee
          shall be void if we are unable to complete any transactions

        <ol>

            If, through no fault of ours, your Eligible Account(s)

            to complete the transaction or the transaction would
            exceed the credit limit of your overdraft account (if
            applicable);

            working properly and you know or have been advised by this

            malfunction before you execute the transaction;

          <li>
            You have not provided the Service with the correct Payment
            Account information, or the correct name, address, phone
            number, or account information for the Biller;
          </li>

            Your Eligible Account(s), including either your Payment
            Account or Billing Account, is closed;

          <li>
            If your computer, software, telecommunication lines were
            not working properly and this problem should have been
            apparent to you when you attempted the transfer or Bill
            Payment;
          </li>
          <li>
            It can be shown that the Biller received the Bill Payment
            within the normal delivery timeframe and failed to process
            the payment through no fault of ours;
          </li>

            The payment or transaction request involves funds subject

            prevents their withdrawal;
          </li>
          <li>
            We have reason to believe that a payment or other
            transaction request may not be authorized by you or any
            third party whose authorization we believe is necessary;
            and/or

            Providers, and this Institution (such as, but not limited
            to, fire, flood, or interference from an outside force)
            prevent the proper execution of the transaction and we

            circumstances.

          Account ,or causes funds from your Payment Account to be

            Telephone us at 205-591-2228 or 800-223-2415 during

          If you think your statement is incorrect or you need more
          information about an electronic transfer or Bill Payment
          transaction listed on the statement, we must hear from you
          no later than sixty (60) days after the FIRST statement was
          sent to you on which the problem or error appears. You must:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Tell us your name, relevant Service account number(s), and
            Access ID;
          </li>
          <li>
            Describe the error or the transaction in question, and
            explain as clearly as possible why you believe it is an
            error or why you need more information; and,
          </li>
          <li>Tell us the dollar amount of the suspected error.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          If you tell us verbally, we may require that you send your
          complaint in writing within ten (10) Business Days after
          your verbal notification. We will tell you the results of
          our investigation within ten (10) Business Days after we
          hear from you, and will correct any error promptly. However,
          if we require more time to confirm the nature of your
          complaint or question, we reserve the right to take up to
          forty-five (45) days to complete our investigation. If we
          decide to do this, we will provisionally credit your account
          within ten (10) Business Days for the amount you think is in
          error. If we ask you to submit your complaint or question in
          writing and we do not receive it within ten (10) Business
          Days, we may not provisionally credit your account.
        </p>
        <p>
          For errors regarding electronic transactions on new consumer
          accounts, we may take up to 90 days to investigate your

          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Tell us AT ONCE if you believe your Access ID or Passcode
          has been lost or stolen. Telephoning is the best way of
          minimizing your possible losses. You could lose all the
          money in your account (plus your maximum overdraft line of
          credit if applicable).
        </p>
        <p>
          If consumer customers tell us within two (2) Business Days
          after you discover your password or other means to access
          your account has been lost or stolen, your liability is no
          more than $50.00 should someone access your account without
          your permission. If you do not tell us within two (2)
          Business Days after you learn of such loss or theft, and we
          can prove that we could have prevented the unauthorized use
          of your password or other means to access your account if
          you had told us, you could be liable for as much as $500.00.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your monthly account statement contains transfers that
          you did not authorize, you must tell us at once. If you do
          not tell us within sixty (60) days after the statement was
          sent to you, you may lose any amount transferred without
          your authorization after the sixty (60) days if we can prove
          that we could have stopped someone from taking the money had
          you told us in time. If a good reason (such as a long trip
          or a hospital stay) prevented you from telling us, we may
          extend the period.

          Service and we are solely responsible to you and any third
          party to the extent any liability attaches in connection

          this Agreement to delegate to Service Providers all of the
          rights and performance obligations that we have under this

          party beneficiaries of this Agreement and will be entitled

          provides to us. Service Provider and certain other

          If a party elects arbitration, that party will initiate such
          arbitration through Judicial Arbitration and Mediation
          Services ("JAMS"), the American Arbitration Association
          ("AAA"), or an established alternative dispute resolution
          (ADR) administrator mutually agreed upon by the parties. The
          parties agree that that the following rules shall apply: (a)
          the arbitration may be conducted telephonically, online
          and/or be solely based on written submissions, at the
          election of the party initiating the arbitration; (b) the
          arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the
          parties, their representatives or witnesses unless otherwise
          mutually agreed by the parties; (c) discovery shall not be
          permitted; (d) the matter shall be submitted for decision
          within ninety (90) days of initiation of arbitration, unless
          otherwise agreed by the parties, and the arbitrator must
          render a decision within thirty (30) days of submission; and
          (e) any award in such arbitration shall be final and binding
          upon the parties and may be submitted to any court of
          competent jurisdiction for confirmation. The parties
          acknowledge that remedies available under federal, state and
          local laws remain available through arbitration. NO CLASS
          ACTION, OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY
          GENERAL ACTION, OR JOINDER OR CONSOLIDATION OF ANY CLAIM

          Money Terms, the "Service") enables you to transfer funds
          between your Account(s) that you maintain with us on the one
          hand, and your Account(s) that are maintained by other
          financial institutions, on the other hand. You represent and
          warrant that you are either the sole owner or a joint owner
          of the Eligible Transaction Account and the External Account
          and that you have all necessary legal right, power and
          authority to transfer funds between the Eligible Transaction
          Account and the External Account. If you are a joint owner
          of the Eligible Transaction Account, External Account, or
          both, then you represent and warrant that (i) you have been
          authorized by all of the other joint owners to operate such
          Accounts without their consent (including without limitation
          to withdraw or deposit any amount of funds to such Accounts
          or to even withdraw all funds from such Accounts); and (ii)
          we may act on your instructions regarding such Accounts
          without liability to such other joint owners. Further, you
          represent and warrant that the External Account is located
          in the United States.
        </p>

          (Service Fees and Additional Charges); or, as applicable, to

          3. The transfer is refused as described in Section 6 of the
          Transfer Money Terms below;

          outside force) prevent the proper execution of the transfer
          and we have taken reasonable precautions to avoid those
          circumstances.
        </p>

        <p>
          6 Refused Transfers. We reserve the right to refuse any
          transfer. We will notify you promptly if we decide to refuse

          b. The Instant Payments feature within the Popmoney Service
          (&ldquo;Popmoney Instant Payments&rdquo;) facilitates
          real-time payments via the use of PIN debit card Payment
          Networks (&ldquo;Debit Card Payment Networks&rdquo;) such as
          Accel&trade; to deliver funds immediately. For Popmoney
          Instant Payments, we will use a Debit Card Payment Network
          or other Payment Network designed to transfer funds on the
          same day or sooner, if practicable, to debit or credit funds
          to the Eligible Transaction Account of the Receiver, as
          applicable. Popmoney Instant Payments is only available for
          Payment Instructions submitted by a Sender to a Receiver
          (and not via a Popmoney Request). Not all Payment Networks
          participate in Popmoney Instant Payments. Popmoney Instant
          Payments are not instantaneous. Payment delivery speed may
          vary based upon the funds availability policy of each
          financial institution and Payment Network availability.

          a. By providing us with names and telephone numbers, email
          addresses, and/or bank account information of Receivers to
          whom you wish to direct payments, you authorize us to follow
          the Payment Instructions that we receive through the
          Service. Once registered, you authorize us to credit your
          Eligible Transaction Account for payments remitted to you on
          behalf of a Sender without further approval from you.

          The Instant Payments feature within the Popmoney Service
          (“Popmoney Instant Payments”) facilitates real-time payments
          via the use of PIN debit card Payment Networks (“Debit Card
          Payment Networks”) such as Accel™ to deliver funds
          immediately. For Popmoney Instant Payments, we will use a
          Debit Card Payment Network or other Payment Network designed
          to transfer funds on the same day or sooner, if practicable,
          to debit or credit funds to the Eligible Transaction Account
          of the Receiver, as applicable. Popmoney Instant Payments is

          Sender to a Receiver (and not via a Popmoney Request). Not
          all Payment Networks participate in Popmoney Instant
          Payments. Popmoney Instant Payments are not instantaneous.
          Payment delivery speed may vary based upon the funds

          c. You acknowledge and agree that if your Payment
          Instructions identify an account by name and account number,
          the relevant financial institution may execute those Payment
          Instructions by reference to the account number only, even
          if such account number does not correspond to the account
          name. You further acknowledge and agree that financial
          institutions holding the account may choose to not
          investigate discrepancies between account names and account
          numbers. We have no responsibility to investigate
          discrepancies between account names and account numbers,
          outside of our obligations under the law to investigate
          errors, described above in Section 22 of the General Terms

          f. It is the responsibility of the Sender and the Receiver

          guarantee such stoppage or recovery and will bear no
          responsibility or liability for damages resulting from

          g. Popmoney Instant Payments: We are not responsible for the

          Payment Networks. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
          in the Agreement, Popmoney Instant Payments settlements are
          final except as set forth in the applicable Payment Network
          rules and recovery may not be possible; however, if
          applicable Payment Network rules allow for reversal of
          funds, we will attempt to recover such funds from the
          Receiver’s Eligible Transaction Account. We shall not be
          obligated to comply with the Automated Clearinghouse (ACH)
          Rules in such recovery efforts or otherwise in connection
          with Popmoney Instant Payments. We are only responsible for

          3 Initiation of Payment Instructions.
        </div>

        <p>
          You may initiate (a) a one-time Payment Instruction to a
          Receiver for which processing shall be initiated
          immediately, (b) a one-time Payment Instruction to a
          Receiver for which processing shall be initiated at a later
          specified date up to one (1) year, and (c) a recurring
          series of Payment Instructions to a Receiver for which
          processing shall be initiated on the specified dates.
          Options (b) and (c) above are not available for Popmoney
          Instant Payments. Further details about each of these
          options can be found on the Site.
        </p>
        <p>
          Payment Instructions initiated to Receivers are processed in
          two ways. You can provide all the required information about
          the Receiver, including his/her Eligible Transaction
          Account, necessary to complete a transfer of funds.
          Alternatively, you can provide contact information about the
          Receiver (including an email address and/or mobile telephone
          number) and the Popmoney Service may contact the Receiver
          and request that the Receiver (i) provide information so
          that we may validate the identity of the Receiver at the
          Popmoney Website and then (ii) provide Eligible Transaction
          Account information in order to complete the Payment
          Instruction (a "Two-Step Transfer"). If the Receiver
          maintains an Eligible Transaction Account with an
          institution that participates in or offers the Popmoney
          Service, the Receiver may access the Popmoney Service at his
          or her financial institution’s website or mobile application
          to complete the Payment Instruction and receive the payment.
        </p>
        <p>
          For Popmoney Instant Payments, you can initiate a Payment
          Instruction using (i) the Receiver’s email address or mobile
          number, and the Popmoney Service will validate the Popmoney
          Instant Payments eligibility of the Receiver prior to
          transferring the funds; or (ii) the Receiver’s debit card
          information, and the funds will be immediately deposited
          into the Receiver’s checking or savings account affiliated
          with the debit card. Not all Payment Networks participate in
          Popmoney Instant Payments. Payment delivery speed may vary
          based upon the funds availability policy of each financial
          institution and Payment Network availability.
        </p>
        <p>
          You understand and agree that when you initiate a Payment
          Instruction from an Eligible Transaction Account using the
          Popmoney Service, the processing of the Payment Instruction
          will begin and the debiting of your Eligible Transaction
          Account will occur as early as the day of such initiation.
          However, other than with respect to Popmoney Instant
          Payments, the payment funds will be transferred into the
          Receiver's Eligible Transaction Account no earlier than the
          next Business Day after you initiated the Payment
          Instruction. If you request a one-time Payment Instruction
          to be initiated on a specified date or a recurring series of
          Payment Instruction to be initiated on specified dates, then
          the processing of the Payment Instruction will begin on the
          specified date and the debiting of your Eligible Transaction
          Account will occur as early as the specified date(s).
          However, the payment funds will be transferred into the
          Receiver’s Eligible Transaction Account no earlier than the
          next Business Day following the specified date. In addition,
          in the case of all Two-Step Transfers, the deposit of the
          payment funds into the Receiver’s Eligible Transaction
          Account (even if debited or withdrawn from your Eligible
          Transaction Account), or receipt of a gift card, if
          applicable, may be delayed if the Receiver has not provided
          the Popmoney Service with certain required information such
          as his or her Eligible Transaction Account information, or,
          in the case of a gift card, if applicable, a valid U.S.
          street address for gift cards that are physically delivered.
          The Site may contain additional information regarding the
          delivery of a payment to an Eligible Transaction Account or
          the delivery of a gift card, if applicable.
        </p>
        <p>
          You acknowledge and agree that we will begin to process the
          requested transfer of funds once the Receiver has provided
          (or we otherwise obtain) all required information, and you
          hereby authorize and direct us to retain such funds until
          the earlier of such time as the Receiver has provided (or we
          otherwise obtain) all required information or ten (10)
          Business Days. You further acknowledge and agree that our
          receipt of money to be transmitted to a Receiver shall not
          be deemed to have occurred and our obligation to complete a
          Payment Instruction shall not begin until such time as the
          Receiver provides us with (or we otherwise obtain) all
          required information necessary to process the related
          Payment Instruction in accordance with this Agreement. Any
          cancellation of a Payment Instruction prior to the Receiver
          providing us with such information shall be subject to the
          provisions of Section 5 of the Popmoney Terms, below.

          If another person wants to initiate a Payment Instruction
          (including in response to a Popmoney Request, if applicable)
          using the Popmoney Service to an Eligible Transaction
          Account you hold or, as applicable, if you as a Requestor
          want to initiate a Popmoney Request, he, she or you can do
          that from the Site or from an Eligible Transaction Account
          at a financial institution that participates in the Popmoney
          Service or at the Popmoney Website. Or, as applicable, if
          another person wants to send you a gift card using the
          Service, he or she can do that from an Eligible Transaction
          Account at a financial institution that participates in the

          through the Service.

          the time you are notified of the pending Payment Instruction
          and the deposit of the payment funds into your Eligible
          Transaction Account, and you may be required to take
          additional steps to facilitate the deposit of the payment of
          funds into your Eligible Transaction Account. You authorize
          the Sender, the financial institution which holds the
          Sender's Eligible Transaction Account and us (including
          through the Site) to send emails to you and text messages to
          your mobile phone in connection with the Sender's initiation
          of Payment Instructions to you, and, as a Receiver, you may
          also receive gift cards or Popmoney Requests, each as
          applicable, from others through the Service.

        <p>
          You acknowledge and agree that in the event that funds are
          transferred into your Eligible Transaction Account as a
          result of a Payment Instruction and it is determined that
          such transfer was improper because it was not authorized by
          the sender, because there were not sufficient funds in the
          sender's account, or for any other reason, then you hereby
          authorize us or our Service Provider to withdraw from your
          Eligible Transaction Account an amount equal to the amount
          of funds improperly transferred to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          If applicable, if you as a Requestor initiate a Popmoney
          Request using the Service you acknowledge and agree that as
          disclosed on the Site (a) the applicable service fee will be
          deducted from payments received by you from a Sender(s), and
          (b) no service fee will be charged if you as the Requestor

          foregoing can be found on the Site. You acknowledge and

          may not receive, or otherwise may reject or ignore, your

          Sender may cancel the initiation of a Payment Instruction or
          stop a Payment Instruction at any time until the processing
          of the Payment Instruction into the Receiver’s Eligible
          Transaction Account has begun. Popmoney Instant Payments
          Payment Instructions may not be cancelled as the Payment
          Instructions will be processed immediately. Our ability to
          stop a Payment Instruction or recover funds associated with
          an unauthorized Payment Instruction will depend on the
          manner in which the Payment Instruction was initiated, and
          whether the Payment Instruction to the Receiver’s Eligible
          Transaction Account has begun processing. Although we will
          make a reasonable effort to accommodate a stop payment
          request and to recover funds associated with an unauthorized
          Payment Instruction, we will have no liability for failing
          to do so. We may also require you to present your stop
          payment request or request to recover funds in writing
          within fourteen (14) days after contacting customer care. If
          we charge you to stop the payment or recover funds, then the
          charge for each stop payment or fund recovery request will
          be the current charge as set out in our current fee
          schedule. Payments not claimed by a Receiver will be
          automatically cancelled ten (10) days after the processing
          of the payment begins. When a Sender initiates a Payment
          Instruction, the Receiver is not required to accept the
          payment. You agree that you as a Sender will not hold us
          liable for any damages resulting from a Receiver’s decision
          to accept or not to accept a Payment Instruction initiated
          or attempted through the Service. We will, to the extent
          permitted by law, make reasonable attempts to return any
          unclaimed, refused, refunded, prohibited, or denied payment
          to your Eligible Transaction Account or use other reasonable
          efforts to return such payment to you as permitted by law.

          1 Description of Service.
        </div>
        <p>
          The term “Bill Payment Terms” means these Bill Payment
          Service Additional Terms. The bill payment service (for
          purposes of these Bill Payment Terms, and the General Terms
          as they apply to these Bill Payment Terms, the "Service")
          enables you to receive, view, and pay bills from the Site.

        <div class="fw-semibold text-lg">2 Payment Scheduling.</div>
        <p>
          The earliest possible Scheduled Payment Date for each Biller
          will be designated within the portion of the Site through
          which the Service is offered when you are scheduling the
          payment. Therefore, the Service will not permit you to
          select a Scheduled Payment Date less than the earliest
          possible Scheduled Payment Date designated for each Biller.
          When scheduling payments you must select a Scheduled Payment
          Date that is no later than the actual Due Date reflected on
          your Biller statement unless the Due Date falls on a
          non-Business Day. If the actual Due Date falls on a
          non-Business Day, you must select a Scheduled Payment Date
          that is at least one (1) Business Day before the actual Due
          Date. Scheduled Payment Dates must be prior to any late date
          or grace period. Depending on the method of payment, your
          Eligible Transaction Account may be debited prior to the
          Scheduled Payment Date. For example, if the selected method
          of payment is a draft, the draft arrives earlier than the
          Scheduled Payment Date due to expedited delivery by the
          postal service, and the Biller immediately deposits the
          draft, your Eligible Transaction Account may be debited
          earlier than the Scheduled Payment Date.

          3 The Service Guarantee.
        </div>
        <p>
          Due to circumstances beyond the control of the Service,
          particularly delays in handling and posting payments by
          Billers or financial institutions, some transactions may
          take longer to be credited to your account. The Service will
          bear responsibility for any late payment related charges up
          to $50.00 should a payment post after its Due Date as long
          as the payment was scheduled in accordance with the Section
          2 of the Bill Payment Terms (Payment Scheduling).

          4 Payment Authorization and Payment Remittance.
        </div>
        <p>
          By providing the Service with names and account information
          of Billers to whom you wish to direct payments, you
          authorize the Service to follow the Payment Instructions
          that it receives through the Site. In order to process
          payments more efficiently and effectively, the Service may
          edit or alter payment data or data formats in accordance
          with Biller directives.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the Service receives a Payment Instruction, you
          authorize the Service to debit your Eligible Transaction
          Account and remit funds on your behalf so that the funds
          arrive as close as reasonably possible to the Scheduled
          Payment Date designated by you. You also authorize the
          Service to credit your Eligible Transaction Account for
          payments returned to the Service by the United States Postal
          Service or Biller, or payments remitted to you on behalf of
          another authorized user of the Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Service will attempt to make all your payments properly.
          However, the Service shall incur no liability and any
          Service Guarantee (as described in Section 3 of the Bill
          Payment Terms) shall be void if the Service is unable to
          complete any payments initiated by you because of the
          existence of any one or more of the following circumstances:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            1. If, through no fault of the Service, your Eligible
            Transaction Account does not contain sufficient funds to
            complete the transaction or the transaction would exceed
            the credit limit of your overdraft account;
          </li>
          <li>
            2. The payment processing center is not working properly
            and you know or have been advised by the Service about the
            malfunction before you execute the transaction;
          </li>
          <li>
            3. You have not provided the Service with the correct
            Eligible Transaction Account information, or the correct
            name, address, phone number, or account information for
            the Biller; and/or,
          </li>
          <li>
            4. Circumstances beyond control of the Service (such as,
            but not limited to, fire, flood, or interference from an
            outside force) prevent the proper execution of the
            transaction and the Service has taken reasonable
            precautions to avoid those circumstances.
            <p>
              Provided none of the foregoing exceptions are
              applicable, if the Service causes an incorrect amount of
              funds to be removed from your Eligible Transaction
              Account or causes funds from your Eligible Transaction
              Account to be directed to a Biller which does not comply
              with your Payment Instructions, the Service shall be
              responsible for returning the improperly transferred
              funds to your Eligible Transaction Account, and for
              directing to the proper Biller any previously
              misdirected transactions, and, if applicable, for any
              late payment related charges.

          You may cancel or edit any Scheduled Payment (including

          portion of the Site through which the Service is offered.
          There is no charge for canceling or editing a Scheduled
          Payment. Once the Service has begun processing a payment it
          cannot be cancelled or edited, therefore a stop payment
          request must be submitted.

          depend on the payment method and whether or not a check has
          cleared. The Service may also not have a reasonable
          opportunity to act on any stop payment request after a
          payment has been processed. If you desire to stop any
          payment that has already been processed, you must contact
          customer care for the Service in the manner set forth in
          Section 22 of the General Terms above. Although the Service
          will attempt to accommodate your request, the Service will
          have no liability for failing to do so. The Service may also
          require you to present your request in writing within
          fourteen (14) days. The charge for each stop payment request
          will be the current charge for such service as set out in
          the applicable fee schedule.

          scheduled at your own risk. In no event shall the Service be
          liable for any claims or damages resulting from your

          described in Section 3 of the Bill Payment Terms) as it

          ExceptionPayments are scheduled and/or processed by the

          The Service includes a feature that electronically presents
          you with electronic bills from select Billers. Electronic
          bills may not be available from all of your Billers.
          Electronic bills are provided as a convenience only, and you
          remain solely responsible for contacting your Billers
          directly if you do not receive their statements. In
          addition, if you elect to activate one of the Service's
          electronic bill options, you also agree to the following:

              <strong>Presentation of electronic bills</strong>
            </div>
            You will receive electronic bills from a Biller only if
            both: (a) you have designated it in the Service as one of
            your Billers, and (b) the Biller has arranged with our
            Service Provider to deliver electronic bills. The Service
            may then present you with electronic bills from that
            Biller if either: (1) you affirmatively elect online
            within the Service to receive electronic bills from the
            Biller, or (2) the Biller chooses to send you electronic
            bills on a temporary “trial basis.” In either case, you
            can elect online within the Service to stop receiving
            electronic bills from a Biller. Electing to receive
            electronic bills, automatically receiving trial electronic
            bills, and declining further elected or trial electronic
            bills all occur on an individual Biller basis. The Service
            does not include an option to prevent ever participating
            in the automatic trial electronic bill feature. When
            affirmatively electing to receive electronic bills from a
            particular Biller, you may be presented with terms from
            that Biller for your acceptance. We are not a party to
            such terms.

          "Biller" is the person or entity to which you wish a bill
          payment to be directed or is the person or entity from which
          you receive electronic bills, as the case may be.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Billing Account" is the checking account from which all

        </p>
        <p>
          "Due Date" is the date reflected on your Biller statement
          for which the payment is due, not the late payment date or
          the date beginning or a date during any grace period.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Eligible Transaction Account" is as defined in Section 36
          of the General Terms, except that it shall be limited to an
          account that you hold with us, and from which bill payments
          will be debited.

          interest in any entity or property).

          "Scheduled Payment" is a payment that has been scheduled
          through the Service but has not begun processing.

          receive your bill payment, unless the Scheduled Payment Date
          falls on a non-Business Day in which case it will be
